# Calculator-JS

A calculator I created on CodePen with JS.  Recreated to reinforce bringing in scripts on a html doc.

This app derived from a challenge presented on FreeCodeCamp.  I created the javascript, css, and html from the ground up on CodePen.  CodePen let's you get to the meat of your projects quickly, not having to worry about bringing in plug-ins or scripts.  But to truly understand how to connect everything I wanted to learn how to add the plug-ins and scripts to the html document myself so I can have a better understanding of what kinds of issues I may run into while putting a JS app together from scratch on a very basic level.
